Before the [wiki document](#https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake/wiki) structure is not very good, and not convenient to retrieve.

So I recently rewritten the document of xmake using [docute](https://docute.js.org/) again.

The Documents:

* [English Document](https://xmake.io)  
* [Chinese Document](https://xmake.io/zh/)
