# Repository Management Commands

## xmake repo

As mentioned above, adding a private repository is available (supporting local path addition):

```console
$ xmake repo --add myrepo git@github.com:myrepo/xmake-repo.git
```

We can also remove a repository that has already been installed:

```console
$ xmake repo --remove myrepo
```

Or view all the added repositories:

```console
$ xmake repo --list
```

If the remote repository has updates, you can manually perform a repository update to get more and the latest packages:

```console
$ xmake repo -u
```
