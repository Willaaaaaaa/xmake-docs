# What is Xmake?

Xmake is a lightweight cross-platform build utility based on Lua. It uses a Lua script to maintain project builds, but is driven by a dependency free core program written in C. Compared with Makefiles or CMake, the configuration syntax is much concise and intuitive. As such, it's friendly to novices while still maintaining the flexibly required in a build system. With Xmake, you can focus on your project instead of the build.

Xmake can be used to directly build source code (like with Make or Ninja), or it can generate project source files like CMake or Meson. It also has a *built-in* package management system to help users integrate C/C++ dependencies.
